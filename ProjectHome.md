A simple software tool to perform a uni-processor time demand analysis on a periodic task set. Include a capability to model explicit deadlines that are smaller than the period. Include a capability to model non-preemptable activities and mutually exclusive access using real-time semaphores within tasks (i.e. include support for blocking times). Use this software to analyze the following workloads to determine which are feasible and which are not. Document the detailed input model that is being subjected to analysis as well as the results of the analysis (e.g. clearly show where any blocking times have been introduced). Where a workload is infeasible, indicate which subset of the tasks will always meet their deadlines and which subset is at risk of missing deadlines.
